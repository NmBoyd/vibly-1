#    Damping that varies linearly with the force of the actuator. This specific
#    damping model has been chosen because it emulates the intrinsic damping of
#    active muscle Since we cannot allow the damping to go to zero for
#    numerical reasons we use

#    d = max( d_min, A*f )
#
#    Where A takes a value of 3.5 (N/N)/(m/s) which comes from Kirch et al.'s
#    experimental data which were done on cat soleus. Fig. 12. Note in Fig.
#    12 a line of best fit has a slope of approximately 0.0035 [N/(mm/s)]/[N],
#    which in units of N/(m/s) becomes 3.5 [N/(mm/s)]/[N]. For d_min we choose
#    a value that is some small value, eta, that will scale with the mass of
#    the body (M) (and thus the expected peak value of F): d_min = A*(M*g)*eta.

# The swing leg for the daslip now has a few options as well:
#
# 0. Constant angle of attack
#
# 1. Linearly varying angle of attack
# The leg of attack varies with time. So that this parameter does not
# have to be recomputed for each new forward velocity, compute the angular
# velocity of the leg, omega, assuming that it scales with the forward
# velocity vx of the body and a scaling factor W
# ('swing_foot_norm_velocity')

# omega = -W(vx/lr)

# thus for an W of -1 omega will be set so that when the leg is straight
# velocity of the foot exactly counters the forward velocity of the body.
# If W is set to -1.1 then the foot will be travelling backwards 10%
# faster than the foward velocity of the body.

# At the apex angle of the leg is reset to the angle of attack with an
# offset (angle_of_attack_offset) so that during the nominal model.step the
# leg lands exactly with the desired angle of attack.

# It would be ideal to set W so that it corresponded to a value that
# fits Monica's guinea fowl, or perhaps people. I don't have this data
# on hand so for now I'm just setting this to -1.1
